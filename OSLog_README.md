#   OSLog usage

###  creation of logger and simple log:

```
    import os
    let logger = Logger(subsystem: "com.example.YourBundeId", category: "networking")
    logger.log("Database launched successfully")
```

 - subsystem: Usually bundleId of application
 - category: any category tag needed, e.g. networking, bluetooth, CoredataManager etc.
 
 
 ###  logging any CustomStringConvertible, where non-numeric types are redacted by default not showing sensitive data:
 `
    logger. log( "Paid with bank account \ (accountNumber)")
 `
 
output in console would be: 
Time                  process      message
09:41:00-868918-0700  YourBundeId  Paid with bank account <private>


 ###  logging any CustomStringConvertible, where non-numeric types are publicly seen:
 `
    logger. log("Ordered smoothie \ (smoothieName, privacy: .public)")
 `
 
output in console would be: 
Time                  process      message
09:41:00-868918-0700  YourBundeId  Ordered smoothie blueberry

 ###  Retrieving logs from archive
